      "description": "I am a software engineer with experience building website and applications using Javascript, React & Reduct, and Ruby on rails. I am truly passionate about programming. I often found myself spending a lot of time thinking about programming puzzles and different way to solve problems. That was the moment I realized I enjoy programming. I competed course from App Academy, one of the most selective bootcamps. Spending 100+ hrs every week, I sharpened my my programming ability in React and JavaScript. I created an Amazon-like website, a money management website, and a javascript game.",
